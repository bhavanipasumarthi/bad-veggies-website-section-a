	<p> Hello, and welcome to Dhrumil's GitHub lesson. If you haven't already, please read this mind-numbing, but hopefully error-free article below.</li>

	<p> This is a pretend article about vegetables: specifically, how long and what color they are. There are many vegetables of various colors in the world. They can be white, blue or yellow--but there are no neon or glow-in-the-dark vegetables in nature! That's why this article is so important--it informs you about the types of vegetables that exist. Once you're done reading, you should be able to identify whether or not what you're eating is a vegetable. How exciting! </p>


	<!-- This is a placeholder for the table of vegetables.-->
	<h5> Vegetables on my shopping list. </h5>
	<div id='veggiestable'></div>

	<p> As you can see in the table above, my shopping list has vegetables of various colors. </p>

	<p> First, let's talk about potatoes. Potatoes are one of the most versatile and widely consumed foods in the world. They come in various shapes, sizes, and colors, each with its unique characteristics. Whether baked, fried, mashed, or boiled, potatoes have earned their place in cuisines worldwide. </p>

	 <h5>Size: A Range of Dimensions</h2>
        <p>
            Potatoes vary greatly in size, but on average, a typical potato measures about 6 inches long and 5 inches wide. However, some types, like fingerling potatoes, are much smaller, while others, like large baking potatoes, can be significantly larger.
        </p>

	 <h5>Types: A World of Variety</h2>
        <p>
            There are countless potato varieties, each suited for specific culinary uses:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Russet potatoes:</strong> Ideal for baking and frying due to their fluffy texture.</li>
            <li><strong>Yukon Golds:</strong> Perfect for creamy mashed potatoes with a buttery flavor.</li>
            <li><strong>Red potatoes:</strong> Retain their shape well, making them great for salads and stews.</li>
            <li><strong>Fingerling potatoes:</strong> Small and flavorful, often used in gourmet dishes.</li>
        </ul>

	 <h5>Color: More Than Just Brown</h2>
        <p>
            While most potatoes are brown, they come in a variety of colors, including yellow, red, purple, and even blue. Sweet potatoes, often grouped with regular potatoes, feature vibrant orange flesh and a natural sweetness. These colors not only make potatoes visually appealing but also hint at their diverse nutrients.

	<p> Now let's talk about gym socks. Gym socks are very smelly. So smelly in fact that they make your feet smell bad. actually, I think that it is the other way around. Feet actually imbue the smell into the socks; the socks are not actually the soure of the smell. Did you know that? Go figure! </p>

	<p> Did you know that <a href="http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2010/04/carrots-used-to-be-purple-before-the-17th-century/">carrots used to be purple? </a> The orange carrot, a staple of modern diets, owes its existence to Dutch growers in the late 16th century who selectively cultivated mutant strains of purple carrots, crossing them with yellow, white, and wild varieties. Before this innovation, most carrots were purple, with occasional yellow and white mutations that lacked the purple pigment anthocyanin. The orange variety may have gained popularity in the Netherlands partly due to its sweeter taste and higher yield. Still, some speculate it also symbolized loyalty to the House of Orange during the Dutch struggle for independence. </p>

	<p> In conclusion, gym socks are not vegetables, carrots were once purple, and now you know the average length of a potato. However, you still don’t know the full distribution of potato lengths or how their lengths vary by type. Hopefully, this article has helped you better determine whether or not what you’re eating is a vegetable.

	<p> If you're reading this, you've reached the end of the article and probably lost a few brain cells. Now we, a group of professional newspeople, are going to work on improving it. Kind of like a reverse mad-libs. I hope this website helped explain some of the class concepts! Goodbye.</p>
